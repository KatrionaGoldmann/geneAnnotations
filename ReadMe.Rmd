# geneAnnotations

This package annotated gene names and annotations. 

For example for the entire gene summary: 

```{r}
gene_df <- gene_summary(genes=c("MS4A1", "FGF1", "SLAMF6"), diseases="C20")
```


```{r}
kable(gene_df, format = "markdown")
```

Or to include publications

```{r}
gene_df <- gene_summary(genes=c("MS4A1", "FGF1", "SLAMF6"), 
                        associated_diseases = FALSE,
                        publications = TRUE)

kable(gene_df, format = "markdown")
```
